collection (is a interface) and collections (is a class) are different...

collection are used to store objects....

collections can only store non-primitive data type ....

we can not store primitive data inside collection so we need to use wrapper class to convert that
primitive data to non-primitive data....and then store it into collection

collections can store any type of object means in one collection we can store int,float,char,String,array..etc

GENERICS:
if we want to store only one type of data/object inside collection then we have to use GENERICS <Object_type>

ex: ArrayList <Integer> lst = new ArrayList<Integer>();
Now this list can only store Integer objects...............
